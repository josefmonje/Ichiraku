                <p>Ramen Ichiraku (ラーメン一楽) is a small restaurant in Konohagakure, a ninja village in the Land of Fire. It has only one menu item: <mark>Ramen</mark>, a Japanese noodle soup dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat- or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, dried seaweed, kamaboko, and green onions.</p>
                <p>The restaurant and ramen bar is operated by Teuchi, who is also the restaurant's chef, and Ayame, his daughter and helper. Ramen Ichiraku is a common setting for various scenes throughout the series "Naruto", often being visited by the protagonist Naruto between arcs. One anime episode is dedicated to the restaurant where in Ayame is kidnapped and Naruto together with his friends must create a perfect ramen recipe for a ransom. Using ninjutsu, Chōji, Sakura, and Naruto make a perfect recipe. At the end of the episode the menu is updated to include diet ramen, which attracts almost every female character from the series to the bar.</p>
